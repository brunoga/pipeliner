// This is needed because a demuxed file is not reliably one track. A Blu-ray
// TrueHD stream carries an embedded AC-3 core as a fallback for players that
// cannot decode TrueHD, and tsMuxeR writes the pair as a single file — named
// ".ac3+thd", which mkvmerge then presents as two tracks. The same is true of
// DTS-HD, whose core is a plain DTS stream.
//
// Guessing is not good enough in either direction. Tagging only track 0 leaves
// the core untagged, so a player sees an audio track of unknown language next
// to the one it was told about. Dropping everything but track 0 without looking
// risks discarding the lossless stream and keeping the core, which is the
// opposite of what was asked for. mkvmerge is the tool that will do the mux, so
// its view is the one that matters, and asking it costs a process start.

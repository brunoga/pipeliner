// Package mvc drives the conversion of a frame-packed Blu-ray 3D source (MVC)
// into a side-by-side MKV that an ordinary decoder can play.
//
// MVC stores the second eye as a dependent view of an AVC base view. Players
// that decode it are rare — Plex does not — so a 3D Blu-ray is unwatchable in
// most libraries even though it carries a full 1080p image per eye. Converting
// it to side-by-side keeps both eyes at full resolution in a single frame that
// any H.264/HEVC decoder handles.
//
// The work itself is done by external programs; this package decides which
// ones a platform needs, finds them, and assembles the commands:
//
//	tsMuxeR   demux the base (AVC) and dependent (MVC) views, plus audio,
//	          subtitles and chapters — the two views are then interleaved into
//	          one stream in process, which is what interleave.go does
//	edge264   decode both views and stack them side by side, as Y4M
//	encoder   x264 or x265, or ffmpeg with a platform hardware encoder
//	mkvmerge  mux the result back together
//
// Installing the programs is left to the operator. What this package guarantees
// is that it will say precisely which are missing, and why each is needed,
// rather than failing partway through a multi-hour run.

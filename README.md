# pipeliner

A media-automation tool that pulls entries from RSS feeds, active searches, or local filesystems, filters them against configurable rules, enriches them with metadata, and hands them off to download clients, notification services, or arbitrary shell commands.

Heavily inspired by [FlexGet](https://flexget.com). Pipelines are described in YAML. Each pipeline task chains a sequence of plugins — one input, any number of filters and metainfo annotators, optional modifiers, and one or more outputs. The scheduler runs tasks on cron or interval schedules.

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/brunoga/pipeliner/cmd/pipeliner@latest
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/brunoga/pipeliner
cd pipeliner
go build -o pipeliner ./cmd/pipeliner
```

## Quick start

```yaml
# config.yaml
tasks:
  breaking-bad:
    rss:
      url: "https://example.com/rss"
    seen:
    series:
      shows:
        - "Breaking Bad"
    transmission:
      host: localhost
      port: 9091

schedules:
  breaking-bad: 1h
```

```sh
pipeliner run               # run all tasks once
pipeliner daemon            # run tasks on their schedules
pipeliner check             # validate config without running
pipeliner list-plugins      # print all registered plugins
```

## Configuration

See [`configs/`](configs/README.md) for the full config format reference and annotated examples.

## Plugins

Pipeliner is built entirely from plugins. Each task is a chain of plugins executed in phase order:

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **input** | Produce entries from sources (RSS, files, searches) |
| **metainfo** | Annotate entries with metadata (quality, series info, TMDb) |
| **filter** | Accept, reject, or leave entries undecided based on rules |
| **modify** | Mutate entry fields (path formatting, field setting) |
| **output** | Act on accepted entries (download, client RPC, notify) |
| **learn** | Persist decisions and state for future runs (seen, series tracking) |

See [`plugins/`](plugins/README.md) for the plugin model and links to every plugin.

## Platforms

Pre-built binaries are available for every [release](https://github.com/brunoga/pipeliner/releases):

| OS | Architectures |
|----|---------------|
| Linux | `amd64`, `arm64`, `arm/v7` |
| Windows | `amd64`, `arm64` |
| macOS | `amd64` (Intel), `arm64` (Apple Silicon) |

## Docker

Multi-platform Linux images are published to the GitHub Container Registry on every release tag:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/brunoga/pipeliner:latest
```

Supported platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`.

```sh
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v pipeliner-data:/config \
  -e PIPELINER_WEB_USER=admin \
  -e PIPELINER_WEB_PASSWORD=secret \
  ghcr.io/brunoga/pipeliner:latest
```

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
|----------------------|---------|-------------|
| `PIPELINER_WEB_USER` | — | Web UI username **(required)** |
| `PIPELINER_WEB_PASSWORD` | — | Web UI password **(required)** |
| `PIPELINER_WEB_ADDR` | `:8080` | Listen address |
| `PIPELINER_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) |
| `PIPELINER_CONFIG` | `/config/config.yaml` | Config file path |

The `/config` volume holds both `config.yaml` and `pipeliner.db` (state database). Mount a named volume or bind-mount to persist across restarts. The config can be edited live through the web UI's **Edit Config** tab.

## Security

### Variable substitution

Config files support `${ENV_VAR}` and `{$ variable $}` substitution, which is applied to the raw YAML bytes before parsing. If a substituted value contains YAML structural characters (newlines, unquoted colons, etc.) it could alter the parsed structure of the config.

**Practical risk is low** — substituted values come from environment variables and the `variables:` block in the config file, both of which are controlled by the operator. If an attacker can set your environment variables, they have broader access to your system anyway.

**Mitigation**: do not source environment variables from untrusted external systems when running pipeliner, and ensure `{$ variable $}` values are simple strings without YAML metacharacters.
